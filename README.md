Hi, I'm Ata Öz.
ITU Math. Engineering. Programming Algorithms Class Labwork 4 Task 2

This is a labwork that we couldn't complete. The question statement is on the Labwork4.pdf. 
I put the java code to initilaze the problem, but the mathematics&algorithm part is empty. 
The problem which involves a non-linear equation could be solved with a numerical method such as Newton-Raphson.
I will try to solve it after the midterms and maybe after '17 fall term ends.


Godspeed!
